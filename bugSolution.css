To solve this problem, we can use more specific selectors or the `!important` flag (use with caution).  Here are two solutions:

**Solution 1: Using a more specific selector**

This approach targets all list items regardless of nesting:

```css
li, li li {
  background-color: red;
}
```

This ensures that both parent and child list items are targeted. You can add more `li li li` etc to catch deeper nesting, but it is not an ideal solution for deeply nested lists.  For a more maintainable solution, see below.

**Solution 2: Using the `!important` flag (use with caution):**

This solution forces the `background-color` to override any other conflicting styles:

```css
li {
  background-color: red !important;
}
```

While this works, overuse of `!important` can make your CSS harder to maintain and debug in the long run. The first solution is generally preferred.
